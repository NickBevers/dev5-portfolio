Hello there, I'm Nick. I'm a student and coding enthousiast who loves biting down on a good project every time of the day.
I have a passion for teaching and learning new stuf. Never too old to learn :wink:

## Something I found out recently:
### The new Logical Assignment operators (LAO's) in ES2021:
With LAO's, some of my check in code become way easier to write and a bit cleaner.

A nice example of this is a use for the logical OR operator "||=".
A way I have been using it, is giving a default value to variables that aren't defined/existing.
I'll use the code below to see if variable 'dogBreed' exists, and if it doesn't, I'll give it the value 'Dalmatian'.
```
let dogBreed
dogBreed ||= "Dalmatian"

// the code below 
console.log(dogBreed)
```
Proof it actually works :stuck_out_tongue:
